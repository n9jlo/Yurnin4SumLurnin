#### Pay It Forward

```dot
graph {
   layout = neato
   node [shape=box, style=filled];
   PIF [label="Play It Forward"];
   node [shape=ellipse, style=normal];
   Humble;
   Giving;
   Conservation;
   PIF -- Humble [label="Not all our effort", len=3.0];
   PIF -- Giving [label="to others", len=1.5];
   PIF -- Conservation [label="Preserve goodwill.", len=1.5];

}
```

We work hard to give others whom we might never know the same or better
advantages of our own good fortune.  We admit that while we strive virilantly
for our aims, that some element of chance and environment come into play.  For
the times where things go well, we thank providence and seek to do homage to
providence by maintaining the same fertility of opportunies for others the will
be rewarded in some same way.

#### Dunno

```dot
graph {
   layout = neato
   Reliable
   fe [label="Fair/Equal"]
   Integrity
   Trust

}
```

Seeks not to confuse or distort as it's a form of lying.

Is Giving a form of power?

#### Humble

We believe in equality.  Each person is entitled to most of the same
kinds of basic civil liberties as the next person.  They deserve some
degree of respect and deserve to be considered fair and honest until 
personal experience proves otherwise.

As we exceed in our abilities and amass more and more "power" or
"control" over our surroundings, we are comforted and grow somewhat
lax and contented.  We look with pity upon those that don't have our
comfort or our power.  Our power might come from knowledge that was
mostly handed to us, but that we might have striven for via study at
a school.  Because we passed examinations of this suckled knowlege, we
feel emboldened and elevated from the states of those that might not
have chosen to attain this knowledge. Because we are in such command
of knowledge and perhaps think that we understand things more than
another or perhaps we feel that we've worked harder or are somehow more
deserving than others.  This leads us to a sense of eliteness and
entitlement.  We have papers that prove how good we are and medals and
accolades from others that resound our good deeds and our heroic efforts.
Others that don't have these things are lesser than us.  They don't deserve
the things that we deserve.  These are the thoughts.  However, this is not
really the case. When opportunities are limited and resources are slim, the
question of best fit comes into play.  Then, it should be via competition
perhaps that the dispatch of the opportunity should be decided.
